# Astolfo Color Theme Extension for Visual Studio

## Overview

The Astolfo extension for Visual Studio is designed to bring a touch of pink to your coding environment. Embrace a softer color palette and create a coding space that reflects your style. Infuse your coding experience with a touch of femboy aesthetics.

I will be adding a Astolfo wallpaper soon.
